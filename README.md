This is a Maven project implementing an ImageJ plugin which allows 
linear frame-by-frame import of compressed video files into a virtual stack. 
Import is done with FFmpeg library and uses org.bytedeco.javacv.FFmpegFrameGrabber class,
a part of javacv package (java interface to OpenCV, FFmpeg and other) by Samuel Audet.
